# ShapeCatcher
Shape Catcher is a 2D Unity game where players control a paddle to catch falling shapes (Circle, Square, Squircle, and Rhombus) that match a target shape displayed on the UI. The objective is to catch the correct shape to increase the score while avoiding incorrect ones, which ends the game.
